# MoodBased Project 


VibeScape is a dynamic, mood-based content platform that adapts its offerings based on the user's emotional state. Users can select or detect their mood, and the application customizes the UI and content—ranging from articles and music to products and visuals—to enhance or reflect that mood. The project aims to create a personalized digital experience that engages users by aligning with their feelings.

# Project Module Description
- **Mood Selector**: Allows users to manually select or use AI to detect their mood.
- **Dynamic Theme Engine**: Adjusts the entire UI (colors, animations, etc.) based on the selected mood.
- **Mood-Based Content Feed**: Curates articles, quotes, music playlists, and videos tailored to the user's current emotion.
- **MoodShop**: A mock shop featuring product recommendations that change with the user's mood.
- **Mood Diary**: A private journal that visualizes daily mood trends.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides dynamic animations and visuals based on mood selections.
